## Formative Assessment - Group 11

#### 1) Self-organization

Good - Everybody participated in a nice introductory discussion. The tone was respectful, and they got to know each other and the project.


#### 2) Suggested Topics

Excellent - All the suggested topics were covered. I also recommend taking a look at the teamwork lecture, to understand more what is expected of you.
