# Meeting feedback - Group 11


#### Meeting Organization

Mark: Pass

Feedback: There were a chair and a minute taker.


#### Agenda 

Mark: Excellent

Feedback: The agenda was shared with the TA sufficiently ahead of the meeting. It followed the template provided by the course and the individual points of action/discussion were clear.


#### Performance of the *Previous* Minute Taker

Mark: Very Good

Feedback: The previous minute taker took a great amount of notes, with good detail. There was also a task distribution from the previous week, but there was none with the distribution of that week. Consider including it in the minute notes of this week, but other than this, great job!


#### Chair performance

Mark: Good

Feedback: The chair ensured that everyone was involved in the meeting discussions. However, the meeting timing deviated quite a bit. New topics were accomodated into the meeting, but with poor time management, with certain topic taking more time than they should've and the meeting going overtime. Keep in mind that you only have 45 mins a week with your TA, and some things you can discuss between yourselves whenever, whilst others, like the stand-up and the demo, can only be discussed during this timeslot, so organize your future agendas and TA meetings accordingly. 


#### Attitude & Relation

Mark: Excellent

Feedback: The team took ownership of the meeting very well. Everyone was active in the meeting and engaged in productive discussions out of their own volition. The overall athmosphere was very nice and constructive. Keep it up!


#### Potentially Shippable Product

Mark: Good

Feedback: The team presented the current state of their application, with decent progress made. However, the improvements from last week did not seem that substantial, especially because during the stand-up many team members mentioned working on admin functionality, but none of it could be presented because it isn't finalized.


#### Work Contribution/Distribution in the Team

Mark : Good

Feedback: The students discussed the action list of last week, and also the plan of this week. The chairman held a stand-up where everybody presented what they worked on last week and made sure everybody was on track. Maybe because the stand-up was rushed in the last minutes of the meeting and you didn't have the time to go into detail on what everyone worked on, the individual contributions seemed somewhat unbalanced.
