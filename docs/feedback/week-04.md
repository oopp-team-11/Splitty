# Meeting Feedback - Group 11

#### Meeting Organization

Mark: Pass

Feedback: There were a chair and a minute taker.


#### Agenda 

Mark: Excellent

Feedback: The agenda was shared with the TA sufficiently ahead of the meeting. It followed the template provided by the course and the individual points of action/discussion were clear.


#### Performance of the *Previous* Minute Taker

Mark: Good

Feedback: The previous minute taker took a decent amount of notes, though they seem quite short for a meeting of 45 mins. Consider writing things more concretely. For example, in the "Questions to the TA" section, you mention with questions you asked the TA, but not the response you receive. What if you forget it after the meeting and want to refer back on it in the notes? The notes contain what agreements you discussed during the meeting, but not what you actually ended up agreeing on. There was also a task distribution in the notes, with assigned people to the tasks. Good job on that!


#### Chair performance

Mark: Excellent

Feedback: The chair ensured that all the topics of the agenda were covered, with appropiate timing for each, and ensured that everyone was involved in the meeting discussions. He also accustomed for new topics requested to be discussed during the meeting, and made sure to bring the discussion back to the main points whenever it was straying unproductively, managing the time accordingly.


#### Attitude & Relation

Mark: Excellent

Feedback: The team took ownership of the meeting very well. Everyone was active in the meeting and engaged in productive discussions out of their own volition. The overall athmosphere was very nice and constructive. Keep it up!


#### Potentially Shippable Product

Mark: Very good

Feedback: The team presented the current state of the their application, with good progress made from last week. Nice job! In the future, consider discussing the architecture/class structure/how exactly you'd want to implement a certain functionality before you actually start working on it, such that you wouldn't ran into the issue of spending a lot of time coding something that in the end can't/won't be merged.


#### Work Contribution/Distribution in the Team

Mark: Excellent

Feedback: The students discussed the action list of last week, and also the plan of this week. The chairman held a standup where everybody presented what they worked on last week and made sure everybody was on track.
