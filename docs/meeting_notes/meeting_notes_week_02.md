# Meeting Notes - Week 02

### Attendance
* Everyone was present and on time for the meeting.

### Approval of agenda
* No more points were added by the participants.

### Announcements by the TA
* Remember to finish the git assignment before friday.
* Also, remember that from this week forward there are weekly requirements to hit, for example the 100 lines of code.
* Feedback of the meetings will be posted on the repository (week 1 & week 2 are already there).

### Git assignment
* Everyone fortunately completed it already, so no discussion was needed.

### Template project
* Everyone cloned the project already and was able to build and run it locally

## Towards Code of Conduct
* Code of Conduct needs to be at least **2000** words
* We need to start splitting the work for making the Code of Conduct
* The Code of Conduct template is on **brightspace**
* **ICM format** in Code of Conduct description (Basically the structureral criteria)
* Possibly use the Teamwork lecture slides as a guideline and/or starting point

### Discuss behaviour
* If you are late or absent there will be no immediate consequences for that person, there are already multiple individual assignments where you can fail, if you do not attend the meeting enough. 
* If it so happens that you are late or absent, try to communicate it to the rest of the group beforehand, and read the meeting notes afterwards.  
* Try and rotate working on frontend, backend etc. Split the different tasks equally.

### Decicion making
* We need to make a todo-list every week, and try to make them during the weekly meeting
* Also at every meeting discuss the todo's from the week before, which have been finished etc.
  
_Some extra info in between_
* For this week we can start coding a base for the project, for example helper functions.
* Also for this week we need to discuss the structure of the project
* And maybe brainstorm together and make global decicions

### Comunnication and Collaboration
* Mattermost will be the first line of communicating
* A discord server will only be for calls and backup if needed, but try to stick to Mattermost
* Possible extra meetings will probably be online, they will also be less official, but if someone isn't there, try and communicate everything that has been discussed.
* The minimal approvals for the merge requests will be set to **3 approvals**
    * Side note for merging:
    * Try not to do interbranch merging, try and only merge a branch with main.
    * Merge quickly to avoid conflicts
    * And before making a merge requests check if there are any pending merge requests and check if there may be a conflict with yours.
    * Try and make small feature branches, this will help to merge more quickly.


## Next meeting
### Global goals for next meeting
* Have the majority of the Code of Conduct written down.
    * We will do this with Markdown and put it on the repository.
* Try and reach the weekly requirements to avoid knock out.

### Next meetings role assignment
* Chair: Midas
* Minutetaker: Marios

## After this meeting
* We held a less official meeting and brainstormed a bit about the project
* We still need to discuss about the Code of Conduct

### Feedback about meeting
* Try and move faster through points and set some global goals for the meeting
* Map the agenda points more, so we can move more quickly
* Maybe have a less rigid agenda and move more freely
