## Opening

Weekly checkup on everyone
* Any personal events we should take into consideration
* How did everyone experience last weeks workload
* Does everyone think they managed to hit the knockout criteria

## Approval of the agenda
Did anyone read the agenda before the meeting and do they have suggestions?

## Points of action
* Evaluate how far we got last week
* Discuss the architecture of the program further so that everyone has an idea of the eventual goal of the project.
* Identify our goals for week 3.
* Assign tasks based on said goals, making everyone has a fundamentally different task than last week.
* Identify possible problems in our current workflow.


## Any other business
* If anybody has something that should be discussed but came up with that after the agenda was finalized (in point 2), he/she should bring that up now so that it can be discussed after all.*

## Questions for the TA
* How much do you check in on our progress during the week?
* Could you give us more insight into how 'lines of java source code' are counted.
  * Do empty lines between attributes or statements count?
  * Do imports count?
  * Do trivial methods (getters, setters etc) count? What if they are generated?

## Question round
If there are any questions, now is the time to ask them.

## Closing
* See if anyone would like to start work after the meeting.
* Ask the TA if she's got anything to add.
