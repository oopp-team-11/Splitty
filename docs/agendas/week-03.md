## Approval of the agenda
Did anyone read the agenda before the meeting and do they have suggestions?

## Points of action
* Evaluate how far we got last week
* Discuss the architecture of the program further so that everyone has an idea of the eventual goal of the project.
* Identify our goals for week 3.
* Assign tasks based on said goals, making everyone has a fundamentally different task than last week.
* Identify possible problems in our current workflow.


# Any other business
*If anybody has something that should be discussed but came up with that after the agenda was finalized (in point 2), he/she should bring that up now so that it can be discussed after all.*
