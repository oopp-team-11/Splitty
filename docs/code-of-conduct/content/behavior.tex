\section{Behaviour}

We treat quite equally each other in the team since the whole understanding of the project and its structure is a necessary condition for each team member.
Although, we see each other strengths and consider it when it comes to the important decisions in our team.

We decided that there won't be any specific punishment for being late apart from helping minute taker with notes from the current meeting.
If person doesn't contribute enough to the project, then it's likely that person won't meet knockout criteria.
This doesn't mean that we don't propose help to our team members, but there are some cases when even meaningful help
is not "key" to the specific team member, unfortunately.

There are always some cases when escalating to external parties is necessary action.
Obviously, when the behavior of the team member is unreasonably disrespectful and others team members'
requests are not considered by this specific team member, then we will likely to approach to TA first.
If TA couldn't help us with this issue, then we are likely to approach academic counselors and course hosts.
