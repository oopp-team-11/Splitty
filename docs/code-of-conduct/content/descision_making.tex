\section{Decision making}

We agreed that most matters that have to do with the decision making process will be discussed and decided upon during the weekly meetings.
During the meetings, we talk about what has already been done and what needs to be done.
We also discuss any issues that have arisen and everyone offers their own ideas of how to solve the problems.

If someone does not agree with something we are discussing or doing, they are encouraged to talk about what they think is wrong and offer their own solution.
We will then discuss the different solutions and decide on the best one mainly by majority vote.
If someone insists that our solution is not correct and we cannot conclude a decision,
then we can seek the help of our teaching assistant to give us some guidance.

Moreover, since the time we have in the meeting is limited we also agreed to discuss our ideas on Mattermost/Discord group or Gitlab issues.
Then we all can vote for that idea using emojis or provide feedback in order to approve or reject that idea.
