\section{Commitment}

Commitment of a chairman and a minute taker can be primarily assessed by the TA's formative feedback. Agenda, quality of a meeting and notes of a minute taker form evidence of their commitment. Their work can be commented and evaluated by the team members under their merge requests that cover organizational matters.

In order to ensure that everyone writes code of sufficient quality, we use code reviews and Gitlab comments to propose changes that would enhance the quality of code. The rule of 3 approvals per merge request additionally ensures that nobody commits poor code and everyone pays attention to details.

Individual knock-out criteria, along with the abovementioned constraints, enforce that each team member must be committed, contribute weekly, participate in the creative process and deliver work of sufficient quality. If we have objections regarding the work of somebody, we should first attempt to discuss with them what we think should be changed. The discussion should be held in a calm, polite, respectable manner, it should be based on reasoning and there should be no personal attacks. If that does not help, we should talk to the TA and together solve the problem.
