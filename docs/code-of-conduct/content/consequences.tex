\section{The consequences of not keeping agreements}

We decided that there will not be additional consequences of not keeping
agreements. If a team member manages to pass the knockout criteria set in place by the university,
then that is enough for us. Enforcing additional consequences might only lead to animosity among team members,
which is not productive.

Instead of enforcing consequences, we will focuss our effort on helping team members keep agreements.
An example technique we will use asking team members for follow-up questions about their agreement. Questions like "how?
", "why?" and "when?" force the team members to make an initial commitment by thinking about their agreement. This acts
as a commitmnent device.
