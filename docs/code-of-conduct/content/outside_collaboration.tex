\section{Outside collaboration}

The need for an additional meeting besides the mandatory TA meeting will be decided weekly in our primary communications channel, Mattermost.\\
If a group of at least 3 team members decide they do want to hold an additional meeting, it is strongly encouraged to do so on \textbf{thursday at 12:00}.
This meeting \textit{must} be accessible online, either via phone call or discord call.\\
Pairs of team members can meet whenever they like, but they must make it known in Mattermost when and where they are planning on meeting,
just to give anyone who's interested in joining in the chance to do so.
