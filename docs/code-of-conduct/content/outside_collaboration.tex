\section{Outside collaboration}

The possible time and place for outside collaboration will be decided weekly and as a group. We won't be holding any
'mandatory' meetings, but team members are encouraged to join. We will make sure meetings can be joined through online
video calls, because we recognise that some team members may not always be near delft.
