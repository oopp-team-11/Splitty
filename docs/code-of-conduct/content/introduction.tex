\section{Introduction}

This Code of Conduct establishes the shared principles that guide our collaboration process throughout this
object-oriented programming project.
By answering questions like ``Why?'', ``How?'', ``When?'' and ``Where?'' we work together,
we lay the foundations for a positive, inclusive, and productive team environment where everyone can get the most
out of their first collaborative software engineering experience.
