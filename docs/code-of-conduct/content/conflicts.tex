\section{Dealing with conflicts}

It's important to distinguish between a disagreement regarding the project and a personal disagreement.

If team members have a disagreement regarding the project,
then we can all have a discussion about it and decide something that is fair for both sides and also beneficial for the project.

If two members have a personal disagreement, not related to the project,
then it's best to keep it outside of the team meetings and discussions and they try solving it themselves.

If they are not able to solve it themselves and the rest of the team still senses some tension between them,
then we can all have a talk about it but not in a weekly meeting but in a separate meeting.
We can hear both sides and with no bias try to help both of the members solve their personal disagreement.

Now if the conflict escalates and it's no longer in the team's hands to find a solution,
then we should definitely seek the help of our teaching assistant.
With their help, we might be able to work something out but even if we don't, the teaching assistant should be informed about the situation.
