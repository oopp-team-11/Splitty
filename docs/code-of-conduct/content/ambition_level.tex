\section{Ambition level}

We are aiming for an 8 or higher for this course.
Those who did not have those standards said that they will try and keep up with the rest, thus not trying to hold them back.

We think an 8 for a grade feels satisfactory, while not being too far-fetched, but still being higher than average grade.
Also, we find it a good target to show that we learned something, instead of chasing only the basic requirements and not doing anything more than asked.
So, hitting this goal will feel more as if we really understand how it works, and having the feeling that we can do more than before.

This will ask some time and effort, but it will reward us with more real life experience than a simple test, because we learn to work together as a team, instead of as an individual.
Thus, improving not only our knowledge, but also our planning and teamwork skills along the way.
