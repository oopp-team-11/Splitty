\section{Shared team values}

\begin{description}
\item [Growth-oriented approach] First and foremost, we treat the project as a learning opportunity.
During the course, we have the opportunity to experiment with new programming concepts, knowing that our mistakes carry minimal consequences.
We treat setbacks as a natural learning process.
We contribute towards creating an environment where everyone can seek help from other team members when struggling to grasp challenging concepts.
\item [Healthy work-life balance] We understand that maintaining a healthy work-life balance is essential for our mental well-being and keeping our minds full of fresh ideas.
That's why we aim to set the deadline for meeting the knock-out criteria on Fridays.
By keeping the weekends free of mandatory involvement in the project, we allow everyone to enjoy their well-deserved time off.
Normalising this rule discourages members from pushing their first merge request with Java code just before the hard deadline on Sunday evening, as it creates a risk of not getting enough approvals.
\item [Transparency] We keep our communication open and honest.
We aim to keep everyone up to date with the project and involved in the decision-making process.
Everyone should proactively provide updates on the issues encountered while working on their weekly objectives, allowing us to work on the solutions together, which keeps us productive at all times.
