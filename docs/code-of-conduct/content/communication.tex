\section{Communication}

The primary communication channel should be the Mattermost server. We should keep there most of the discussions about the project and ongoing work. It is also a place, where we can ask our TA for clarification if we have any questions regarding the course.

We can also communicate through the Discord server, however we should aim to keep discussions there off-topic. Gitlab can be used for commenting and reviewing the code of others, and to give or request feedback. If someone wants to change something in a merge request, they should communicate it on the Gitlab, providing a sensible explanation. Gitlab issues can be used also as a planning tool.

If someone cannot participate in a meeting, Discord may also be used for video/audio calls, assuring that hybrid or online meetings are also possible.
